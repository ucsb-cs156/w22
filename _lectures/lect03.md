This lecture was a bit "on the fly" because the instructor had an unexpected medical appointment immediately before lecture.

We discussed the NSF Grant, and the fact that there is a survey for extra credit.

If you haven't taken the survey, yet please do so.  The link was put on the Slack, and also
appears under "Instructor Announcements" on Gauchospace (you should have also received an email
reminder on Saturday 10/17 to take this before the final deadline, 8pm Monday 10/20).

We also did the "rose and thorn" exercise in your teams.

We then provided help for students that were working on programming assignment jspa01.
