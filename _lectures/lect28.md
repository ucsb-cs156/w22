# Today's work

* All but one of the 10 teams is now at or above 100 points.
  - The one team is at 85, and has a 40 point issue "almost done", so they will get there too, shortly.
  - The PR is in, and they are just working on test cases, getting in mergable, etc.
  - For that team, this final PR is today's focus
* All other teams: you may use the time to 
  - Focus on planning / execution of your final presentation.

# There may be one last short homework assignment

I will be making one final homework assignment, which is more of the nature of a "reflection" piece.   It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes of time.

I'll ask you to reflect on 
- what you learned in the course
- what directions you'd suggest for the product you worked on
- what advice you would give to future students
  
# Suggestions for the final presentation planning process

You may under take this any way you see fit.   The following is just a suggesiton of how to go about this, not a requirement.

1.  Perhaps start by listing the new features that your team contributed, focusing on what the user sees/experiences.
2.  For each of those, note who worked on those.
3.  Decide what order is best to present those features.
4.  Do a practice walk through of demoing those, and decide what that demo should look like.
5.  Decide if there are any other things you want to say in your video
    - Specific technical challenges that were interesting.
    - Specific non-technical challenges that were interesting.
    - Advice to future CS156 students on how to have a good experience in this course.
6.  List anyone specific you want to thank in terms of fellow students, LAs, TAs (omit Conrad, per the instructions; you may thank him in other contexts, but leave that out of the videos please!)

Decide whether you want to have multiple presenters, or just one presenter.

Then, try doing a run through with recording.   

# What happens to unfinished work?

If your team has already reached 100 or 110 points, it aises the question of what happens with issues that are still "in progress" or PRs that are still not yet merged into main.

If your team is already at above 100 points, there is no obligation to work on this for a "grade".

Having said that, there may be reasons you are motivated to continue, such as:
* You want or need to get from 100 or 105 to  >= 110 points in order to maximize your grade via extra credit.
* You are invested in the story, and want to see it through so that it makes it into the product.   You have worked hard, and want to see it across the finish line for the personal satisfaction.
* You still feel like you are learning, and you are more invested in the learning than in the grade.

For Whatever work is left "unfinished" from W21:  here's what happens:
* It becomes work for S21 teams.
* We will create a new issue that's a clone of the old issue; then link the new one to the old issue, old branch, and old PR if any.
* The new S21 teams may choose to start from scratch, or build on your work in progress, as they see fit.
