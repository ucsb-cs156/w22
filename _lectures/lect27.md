# Final Presentations

* Tuesday, March 16, noon-2:50 (Pacific Time), in the regular zoom room.
  - There will be one hour for each of the three projects.
  - UCSB courses search, noon-1pm 
  - Ten minute break: 1pm-1:10pm
  - UCSB CS LAs (1:10-2pm) (ten minute break)
  - Mapache (2-2:50)
* Each team will have 5-10 minutes to present, and then five minutes for live demo, plus Q&A by staff. 

# Final Presentation Participation Assignment

(This will count as a participation assignment in your final course grade.)

* You'll be asked to critique each team's presentation, including your own.
  - Write down what you liked, and what could have been improved.
* You'll then be asked to put the presentations in one of three groups: top, middle, bottom.  
  - Give a brief justification (one sentence is enough)
* Each group must have either three or four presentations in it (total of 10).

* You are invited to consider these factors, and weigh them according to your own sense of how important they are:
  - Clarity of presentation: did you understand what the speakers were saying?
  - Impact on the application: how much did the team accomplish in terms of improving the application?
  - Presentation Style: Was the presentation enjoyable to listen to?
  - Working as a team: Did you have a sense from the presentation that the team worked well together and supported one another?

# Final CATME.org survey

This will be opened immediately after the final course presentations, and will be open for 48 hours.
